Still figuring this one out
Current idea is to make the base type of an unspecified enum a type variable
When we create the type variable, it should be constrained to be numeric and unsigned
(Unit base type is still possible, if enum has no variants, just do that instead of a type variable)
After we compile enum values to consts, decide what that type var should be if it's not yet determined
